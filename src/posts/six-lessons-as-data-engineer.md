I have completed my first year as a Data Engineer. There were a lot of challenges but it was definitely the year that I have learned most. Just giving you a personal background experience.

I'm a Computer Engineer student (almost graduated) and also I work as a Data Engineer for a big e-commerce company in Brazil. And in this first year taught me a lot of good lessons, and bad as well, and I would like to share some of them with you.

# 1: IT IS NOT EASY

I don't want to discourage anyone, but yes, it is hard. Actually this is what makes the data world more captivating: the need to create new solutions and build complex pipelines for several kind of problems. We don't have to think just about the problem and how to solve it, but we must also build it! And this demands two skill areas: hard and soft skills.

> Hard skills are technical skills and must be improved by time with study and resilience. For example: code in Java, draw data pipelines or debug a code.

> Soft skills are part of your personality, but don't think wrong, you can improve your soft skills. Examples: communication, leadership and humility.


# 2: YOU MUST BE SELF-TAUGHT

Because it is hard, Data Engineering requires you to be a self-taught person. This means that you must be able to learn new programming languages, data structures and new emerging technologies by your self. Of course you can have other person help, but, the only person responsible for success, is you alone.

Here is a good article on how to become a self-taught person.
# 3: TECHNOLOGY MOVES FAST

And each day faster! There's one mistake that almost every tech person faces: due to new technologies and tools, we try to improve the system or code always to the newest technology and, because of that, we never finish the current project. Of course, we must follow the new technologies, but we must know the right time to use each one of them.
# 4: PROBLEMS SOLVING

Every data team has problems to solve (this is engineering, isn't it?). Everyday new demands and challenges come. For that, we must not only focus on how to solve the problem, but we must focus on what is the best way to solve the problem. What is the best tool, the best schema or the best pipeline. As a data engineer, you must be able to withstand the pressure of new problems coming every day.
# 5: COMMUNICATION

In my opinion, communication is one of the most important soft skill. Before a data engineer start to build a new pipeline or new project, he must understand what does the requesting area really want, what kind of data the project requires, what is the best tool to solve the problem or at least know how to search for the best tool, and the list of variables just grows.

In short terms, we must not only focus on the coding and infrastructure side, but also on the problem that we will potentially solve and what advantage this new project will offer to the company. This will help you to prioritize new tasks and don't just execute
# 6: YOUR OPINION MATTERS

The last thing that I've learned is that your opinion is important! Yes! I was used to just listen to new tasks and execute them with the best effort I could. But as you grow in your career, you will realize that your teammates need to know your knowledge too. You will stop just executing tasks and will begin to improve the task and giving your thoughts about it, and this will improve your career and will help the team with your experience.
LAST TOUGHS

The data engineering world is a huge place to learn. It takes you to use the maximum capacity of each framework and tool to get the greatest results. It's all about having curiosity and willing to learn more and to help others get the right data!

It has been a wonderful and challenging year, but I'm sure that I'm only on the beginning of my journey. What encourages me to grow in Data Engineering are the possibilities of ways to help companies and people to solve problems giving them the correct data with velocity, variety, value veracity.
